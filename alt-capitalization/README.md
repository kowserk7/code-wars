Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.
For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.
The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.
Good luck!

This was pretty simple, I used the odd calcautor that i used on an old kata and added them to the string. used the to lower case and upper case to the even and odd charaters.
